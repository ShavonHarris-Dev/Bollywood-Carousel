My learning was focused on pushing myself and making a carousel without a framework. I wanted this carousel to advance automatically and to use a setTimeout. 

## Optimizations
When I improve this project, I would update my media queries and would focus on a mobile-first approach. With the CSS I would center the carousel and also try again with the buttons. I wanted to go for a retro look, but I do not like the way they came out. 

## Lessons Learned:

Don't forget to update the media queries to make sure everyone can see your content, rather than just the people that have a screen size like yours and center the carousel so that it its a better user experience.
